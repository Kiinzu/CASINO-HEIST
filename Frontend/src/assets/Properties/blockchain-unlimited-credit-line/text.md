Imagine after losing that much when your team fully looted Inju Bank, the Casino has to create a new Bank to maintain their wealth, so they did just that. **New Bank** is now created with the inovation of one of the oldest blockchain standard, the ERC20, they think they are safe now, but are they? Well, we leave it to you to figure it out!

## ERC-20 Standard

**ERC-20** is a technical standard for *Fungible tokens* on the Ethereum Blockchain. Introduced in 2015, it definse a common set of rules that all tokens must follow to ensure interoperability across the Ethereum ecosystem. Fungle Tokens are identical in **value** and **functionality**, meaning one token is exactly the same as another (like 1 ETH being equivalent to any other 1 ETH).

By adhering to the ERC-20 Standard, tokens can seamlessly interact with wallets, decentralized applications (dApps), and exchanges.

## What is ERC-20 Used For?
The ERC-20 Standard is widely used for a variety of purposes, including:
- **Cryptocurrencies and Payment Tokens**
    Many project issue ERC-20 tokens to represent cryptocurrencies, allowing easy transfers and payment within the Ethereum network.
- **Utility Tokens**
    Some dApps use ERc-20 tokens to grant access to specific services or products within their platforms (e.g., Chainlink's `LINK` token)
- **Stablecoins**
    ERC-20 tokens are often used to represent **stablecoins** pegged to fiat currencies (e.g., USDT, USDC), enabling low-volatility transaction on the blockchain.

## So, is it vulnerable?
When implemented correctly, the ERC-20 Standard present no vulnerabilities, but when it got modified to fit some logic or requirmenet of the application or tokens, it may introduce some vulnerabilities if not checked once again. Any `Deviation from ERC-20 Standard` doesn't necessarily introduce a vulnerability, but it can indeed **bring risks** if not carefully designed and implemeted.
