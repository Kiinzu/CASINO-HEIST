Who doesn't want to be called *NOBLE*, respected by people and always look dashing in the eyes of others. In this casino, the word *NOBLE* doesn't give you all that things, it's just a word used by people, those who have the power to do so can be called *NOBLE* and it's just a symbol here... but, why don't we aim a little bit higher? *TRUE NOBLE*, yeah that title suits us better. So, do you know how we can get that symbol? The symbol of **TRUE NOBLE** &nbsp;

## ERC-721 Standard
ERC-721 is a *Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Standard* on the Ethereum Blockchain. Unlike ERC-20 tokens, ERC-821 tokens are unique and indivisible, meaning no two tokens are the same, and they cannot be split into smaller units. Each token has a unique ID (usually represented as *uint256*) which distinguishes it from every other token. &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

This standard provides the foundation for *NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)*-- digital assets that represent ownership of unique items such as art, collectibles or game assets. &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

## What is ERC-721 Used for?
ERC-721 is used to represent ownership of **unique digital items**.  Some common use cases include: &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

- **Digital Art and Collectibles**
    NFTs are used to tokenize digital artworks or collectibles, allowing them to be traded, auctioned, or transferred while preserving **ownership** and **provenance** &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  
- **Gaming Assets**
    NFTsrepresent in-game asseets (e.g., skins, weapons, or achievement), enabling players to **own and trade unique items** outside the game ecosystem &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  
- **Music and media Rights**
    Musicians and content creators can tokenize their work, offering NFTs to represent **ownership**, **royalties**, or **access rights** to songs, videos or exclusive content &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  
- **Domain Names**
    NFTs are used to register unique *Ethereum name Service (ENS)*, giving users ownership over **blockchain-based domains** &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  

## Common Misimplementations of ERC-721
Though ERC-721 provides a standard structure, **incorrect implementations** can itroduce bugs, vulnerabilities, or unexpected behaviors. Below are some examples &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

- **Missing *safeTransferFrom()* implementation**
    ERC-721 includes **two types** of token transfers, *transferFrom()* and *safeTransferFrom()*. The *safeTransferFrom()* ensures that the receiver (smart contract, since EOAs are not checked) are able to receiving NFTs, if developer only implement *transferFrom()* and skips *safeTransferFrom()*, tokens might be transferred to a contract that cannot handle them. &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  
- **Access Control Issuess (Minting and Burning)** 
    If access control is not implemented correctly for **minting or burning tokens**,  unauthorized users might mint unlimited NFTs or burn tokens owned by others. &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  

When implementing standard, most of the time the vulnerability exist not because of the standard itself but the misimplementation done by the developer, we can say most of the time is human error factor.
