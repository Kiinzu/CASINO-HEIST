In the heart of the Casino lies the ultimate test of influence, ENUMA and ALPHA are going head to head to see which one of them actually has the most influence there. In order for one of them to win they must reach a certain point in the Vote, well by data we can know that ALPHA reign above everything in the Casino, but by "system", we know that ENUMA can win, why? I don't know-- you might be know how, but sure, once that happened, everything will be in **FRENZY** &nbsp;

## Logic Errors

Logic error in smart contracts refers to a flaw or unintended behavior in the design or implementation of the contract's logic, unlike bugs like overflow or reentrancy attacks, logic errors occur when the contract **doesn't perform the expected task correctly**, even though the code is syntactically correct. This can lead to unexpected outcomes, like financial loss, or security vulnerabilities. Some of the example may include but not limited to: &nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

1. **Voting System Logic Flaw** &nbsp;  
    A voting contract may incorrectly count votes, changing the voters status, incorrectly assign vote to the candidates, etc. &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  
2. **Incorrect Access Control** &nbsp;  
    A contract might incorrectly assign permissions, enabling unauthorized actions. &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  
3. **Flawed Token Distribution Logic** &nbsp;  
    A logic error in a token contract may result in extra tokens being minted or distributed incorrectly, or funds being locked unintentionally. &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  
4. **Inconsistent Condition Checks** &nbsp;  
    A conditional statement might contain errors, such as checking *if (x > 0)* when it should be *if (x >= 0 )*, which could lead to unexpected rejection or allow unintended operations. &nbsp;  
    &nbsp;  

There are many other example of this, but we want to highlight the most common logic flaw that exist out there.
