## Denial of Service (DoS)
Traditional network security **Denial of Service (DoS)**, is an attack that occurs when an interference to a service is reduced or eliminated its availability, not only network that has this kind of problem but smart contract could also possess this problem. So how can smart contract possess this problem?

Smart Contract Denial of Service (DoS) can happen when a code has a logic errors, compatibility issues, excessive call depth or actually anything that causing smart contracts to do its function properly. Quoting from [Slowmist article](https://www.slowmist.com/articles/solidity-security/Common-Vulnerabilities-in-Solidity-Denial-of-Service-DOS.html), DoS in smart contracts can be divided to three causes:

1. **Code Logic**
    This type of DoS is mostly caused by the smart contract logic, for an example allowing a contract to loops through a super-long array may consume a huge amount of gas, making the Smart Contract in accessible.
2. **External Calls**
    Smart Contracts can comunicate with each other, if a smart contract communicate or make a call to another smart contract, in which the call resulting in change of state in the caller contract, if it's unchecked whether the call failed or success, it could possess a DoS threat to the caller Smart Contract.
3. **Operation Management-based DoS**
    If a smart contract has a privilege or Role-base access control, let's say one is having `owner()` and it's crucial for a function to run, for example `transfer()` that require `owner()` approval, if by any chance the owner lost it's private key, then the function would never be able to be called, thus suspending all the transfer functionality.

Based on what you've read above, the impact of DoS in smart contract most of the time will be either loss of balance (Funds Locked, Inaccessible) or loss of funtionality, or might be both.
